        "today": "6 AM- Time to tap into your inner kiddo and ride the annual wave of holiday anticipatory excitement. 'Twas the day before Christmas, and all across the slopes skiers flew giddy like children with fresh powder hopes. Early morning sunbeams refracting off the freshly groomed snow will glisten and guide you back to the village below. Increasing clouds will form through the day, fueling sweet dreams of deepness in the wake of St. Nicholas' sleigh. Temperatures are set to soar near 30 at the summit and well into the 40s in the valley. So, away from the tram dock you'll fly like a flash to stuff one more turn in your secret little stash. More rapid than eagles, the holidays came, so whistle and shout; everyone exclaim, Winter's a magical season when wonder is the name of the game. -Lege",
