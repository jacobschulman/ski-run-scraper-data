        "today": "6 AM- Christmas greetings on a wild weather morning here in Jackson. Despite tough flying for the tiny reindeer, Santa was able to swing through and fully stuff the stockings that were hung in the higher elevations. 7 inches in total were delivered over the past 24 hours, with 5 falling overnight. The tempest will pull out of town on St. Nick's heels today as morning snow and rain transitions to mostly cloudy afternoon skies. Warm highs will hover near 30 outside Corbet's Cabin and soar into the low to mid 40s in the Village. Gusty southwest winds will continue through the day in the 10-30 mph neighborhood. Don't let the dark view out the window cause you dismay. Your \"white Christmas\" dreams are but a tram trip away. So, step inside our dashing red sleigh and feast upon the big-mountain yuletide buffet. -Lege",
        "yesterday": "6 AM- Time to tap into your inner kiddo and ride the annual wave of holiday anticipatory excitement. 'Twas the day before Christmas, and all across the slopes skiers flew giddy like children with fresh powder hopes. Early morning sunbeams refracting off the freshly groomed snow will glisten and guide you back to the village below. Increasing clouds will form through the day, fueling sweet dreams of deepness in the wake of St. Nicholas' sleigh. Temperatures are set to soar near 30 at the summit and well into the 40s in the valley. So, away from the tram dock you'll fly like a flash to stuff one more turn in your secret little stash. More rapid than eagles, the holidays came, so whistle and shout; everyone exclaim, Winter's a magical season when wonder is the name of the game. -Lege"
