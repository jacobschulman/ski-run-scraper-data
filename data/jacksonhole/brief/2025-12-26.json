        "today": "6 AM- Pop outta bed and head for the Village, because the lull in the weather just won't wait. After a 3-inch daytime touch-up in the higher elevations yesterday, we stand poised for a cooler, full mountain punch of precipitation today. Pockets of powfall could break out at any moment on the slopes and will increase in intensity as the day flows. Gusty southwest winds will pick up as well, eventually cranking in the 10-40 mph range. Expect high temperatures to stall out in the low 20s at the summit and the upper 30s in the base area. By now excited powder-senses should have you tingling more than a three-ring show from the Brothers Ringling. The atmospheric energy is building, and the eggnog's gone. So, come clown around and do a little slope-side mingling. -Lege",
        "yesterday": "6 AM- Christmas greetings on a wild weather morning here in Jackson. Despite tough flying for the tiny reindeer, Santa was able to swing through and fully stuff the stockings that were hung in the higher elevations. 7 inches in total were delivered over the past 24 hours, with 5 falling overnight. The tempest will pull out of town on St. Nick's heels today as morning snow and rain transitions to mostly cloudy afternoon skies. Warm highs will hover near 30 outside Corbet's Cabin and soar into the low to mid 40s in the Village. Gusty southwest winds will continue through the day in the 10-30 mph neighborhood. Don't let the dark view out the window cause you dismay. Your \"white Christmas\" dreams are but a tram trip away. So, step inside our dashing red sleigh and feast upon the big-mountain yuletide buffet. -Lege"
