        "today": "The storm has passed after depositing another 7\" across the slopes of Rendezvous Mountain keeping our Upper Mountain ski conditions in prime form. Yesterday's high winds have buffed certain aspects to perfection. Today will have clear and sunny skies throughout, with calm to light winds trending out of the NW at 5-12 MPH. Cold temperatures have moved in with the sunshine to help preserve our deepening base. The Top of The World will see temps max out in the low single digits while the valley floor will reach the mid-teens by late afternoon. Come and celebrate the final Sunday of the year with some fun in the sun and give those early season legs a workout. Today will be a beauty! -MB",
        "yesterday": "6 AM- Grab your snow-globing gear and get ready to disappear behind a cloud of white, as wind-whipped snow coats and softens everything in sight. 8 inches of fresh on the upper elevations over the past 24 hours will be additionally padded through the day by waves of snowfall in varying intensities. Come prepared for cooler temperatures, which dip in the afternoon, after peaking late morning in the upper teens at the summit and near 30 in the Village. Strong winds from the west-southwest will bring the welcome promise of free refills as well as the pesky potential for lift interference while they crank between 10 and 40 mph. Come get a dose of crystal medicine. It's the ultimate solution for any disillusion, and days like this make moments of bliss a foregone conclusion. Besides, it's the final weekend of 2025, and you're long overdue for a powder infusion. -Lege\n "
