        "today": "Abundant sunshine and bluebird skies will accompany your trip to the Rendezvous dreamscape on today's ski adventure. As 2025 nears its end, snow filled rewards await those who finish their year carving their signature on the meticulously prepared slopes of the high country. Look for clear and sunny skies throughout the day with a light breeze trending out of the NW at 5-10 MPH. Temperatures will reach the high teens at the Top of the World while Teton Village will hit the mid-20's by early afternoon. It will be a perfect day to create your own adventure on the final Monday of the year, so finish strong. Stay safe out there and please remember to obey all closed area signs. They are there for a reason. Cheers!!! -MB",
        "yesterday": "The storm has passed after depositing another 7\" across the slopes of Rendezvous Mountain keeping our Upper Mountain ski conditions in prime form. Yesterday's high winds have buffed certain aspects to perfection. Today will have clear and sunny skies throughout, with calm to light winds trending out of the NW at 5-12 MPH. Cold temperatures have moved in with the sunshine to help preserve our deepening base. The Top of The World will see temps max out in the low single digits while the valley floor will reach the mid-teens by late afternoon. Come and celebrate the final Sunday of the year with some fun in the sun and give those early season legs a workout. Today will be a beauty! -MB"
