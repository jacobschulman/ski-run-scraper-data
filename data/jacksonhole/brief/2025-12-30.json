        "today": "6 AM- Greetings and good morning, Jackson Hole. Grab your favorite gear and enjoy gravitational sensations galore, as we wrap up the year with sunflakes, snowshine, and more. Get as high as you comfortably can this morning to take full advantage of the inverted temperatures and to take in the unrivaled alpine views afforded by the deep emerald skies. Following the inversion, highs will top out in the mid-20s at the summit and the mid-30s in the Village. A mellow breeze clocking in at under 10 mph from the northwest will round out the blue-sky backdrop of your fractal fantasy. So, come kick those crystals skyward and spend 2025's remaining days suspended semi-weightless in a frozen vapor haze. -Lege",
        "yesterday": "Abundant sunshine and bluebird skies will accompany your trip to the Rendezvous dreamscape on today's ski adventure. As 2025 nears its end, snow filled rewards await those who finish their year carving their signature on the meticulously prepared slopes of the high country. Look for clear and sunny skies throughout the day with a light breeze trending out of the NW at 5-10 MPH. Temperatures will reach the high teens at the Top of the World while Teton Village will hit the mid-20's by early afternoon. It will be a perfect day to create your own adventure on the final Monday of the year, so finish strong. Stay safe out there and please remember to obey all closed area signs. They are there for a reason. Cheers!!! -MB"
