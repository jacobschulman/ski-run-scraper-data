        "today": "6 AM- Head for the hills and get way outta town, because we got the thrills to fuel a proper New Year's countdown. Start your day above the valley chill with an early hop on the aerial tram. That will give the excuse to down a final sticky waffle of 2025 before dropping down 4,000 feet of silky, sunbathed slopes. Rejoice or reflect; take your pick because conditions are primed for both. Blazing sunshine and gentle west winds will illuminate the faded memories of bygone turns and ignite new inspirations from the blinding light of your fall-line future. Highs following the morning inversion will push into the mid-30s in Teton Village, while the summit hangs around the 30-degree mark. Come party-shred that ego to sleep as we celebrate another celestial dance around the sun. After all, who cares if you blew a turn? What lies behind us can't be undone, so make for the lift and that next epic run. -Lege",
        "yesterday": "6 AM- Greetings and good morning, Jackson Hole. Grab your favorite gear and enjoy gravitational sensations galore, as we wrap up the year with sunflakes, snowshine, and more. Get as high as you comfortably can this morning to take full advantage of the inverted temperatures and to take in the unrivaled alpine views afforded by the deep emerald skies. Following the inversion, highs will top out in the mid-20s at the summit and the mid-30s in the Village. A mellow breeze clocking in at under 10 mph from the northwest will round out the blue-sky backdrop of your fractal fantasy. So, come kick those crystals skyward and spend 2025's remaining days suspended semi-weightless in a frozen vapor haze. -Lege"
