        "today": "6 AM- Happy 2026, everyone! There's little time for the party-weary to ease into things because Baby New Year is waking up with energetic intentions. Clouds will be building through the day in prelude to afternoon snow showers. Mild highs will hang in the upper 20s on the deck of Corbet's Cabin and push into the mid-30s down in the Village. Gentle winds from the west-southwest will slowly usher in this year's inaugural storm as they breeze through between 5 and 10 mph. So, prepare to join in on our next powder-plundering revolution. Let this afternoon's incoming crystals be the inspirational catalyst for your next resolution. Because regardless of affliction, fresh falling snow is the ultimate solution. -Lege",
        "yesterday": "6 AM- Head for the hills and get way outta town, because we got the thrills to fuel a proper New Year's countdown. Start your day above the valley chill with an early hop on the aerial tram. That will give the excuse to down a final sticky waffle of 2025 before dropping down 4,000 feet of silky, sunbathed slopes. Rejoice or reflect; take your pick because conditions are primed for both. Blazing sunshine and gentle west winds will illuminate the faded memories of bygone turns and ignite new inspirations from the blinding light of your fall-line future. Highs following the morning inversion will push into the mid-30s in Teton Village, while the summit hangs around the 30-degree mark. Come party-shred that ego to sleep as we celebrate another celestial dance around the sun. After all, who cares if you blew a turn? What lies behind us can't be undone, so make for the lift and that next epic run. -Lege"
