        "today": "6 AM- Greetings, Jackson Hole. It's the first weekend of 2026, and we're here to supply your latest big-mountain fix. Following four warm inches of pow and a little wind whippin', we've got something for everyone sprinkled in the mix. Clouds and sunshine will dance across the sky, taking turns at the lead. Come equipped for mild temperatures that tickle the 30-degree mark at the summit and 40 in Teton Village. South to southwest winds will pick up a touch this afternoon ahead of the next round of moisture, eventually cranking between 10 and 30 mph. Since the recent weather and warmth have nearly eradicated the scratchin', sniff around. Because it's always past the next curve that your ultimate crystal destiny is found. -Lege",
        "yesterday": "6 AM- Climb on out from under those covers; we've got a better blanket. 5 fluffy inches fell overnight at all elevations, and periods of heavy powfall are poised to continue through the day. Gusty west winds in the 10-30 mph range will be whipping up white vapor trails, adding to the storm's beautiful chaos. Mild temperatures will rise to the mid-20s at the summit while the Village hits the mid-30s. The flanks of Rendezvous Mountain are being fully redesigned. So, empty your mind. Take a trip on the tram and leave those alpine inhibitions behind. But beware. You're entering a white-room wormhole where reality refuses to be defined. -Lege"
