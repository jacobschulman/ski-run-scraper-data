        "today": "6AM - Accumulation continues up high with 7\" of new snow in the last 24 hours! 4 of those inches have fallen since lifts closed yesterday and the white stuff continues to fall above 7000 feet this morning. This round of snow will continue to produce during the morning hours before lightening up in the early afternoon as the band of moisture makes its exit. Expect winds to increase as precipitation decreases throughout the day - 40mph gusts out of the west are possible. Base temps will stick in the mid-30s while upper elevations just clear 20. More snow looks to be on the way after closing time today. Enjoy! -OH",
        "yesterday": "The Holiday weekend closes out with another 5\" of fresh snow since lifts closed yesterday. The high mountain terrain has been refreshed and awaits your inspection on this first Sunday of the year. Look for cloudy skies bringing more snowfall throughout the morning and then moving into mixed precipitation by early afternoon. Temperatures will hover in the low to mid-20's at the summit while the base area will reach the upper 30's by lunchtime. Moderate winds will be trending out of the WSW at 12-20 MPH with some afternoon gusts up near 30 MPH. The new snow will be creamy, and the high elevations will be offering up delicious Sunday treats. Come out for a snack! -MB"
