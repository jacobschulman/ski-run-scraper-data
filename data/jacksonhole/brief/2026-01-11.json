        "today": "Keep your weekend momentum in forward motion with bluebird skies and a slight morning temperature inversion. Look for clear and sunny skies throughout the day with light to moderate winds trending out of the West. Temperatures will reach the low 20's across the high elevations while the valley floor will climb into the low to mid-30's by late afternoon. Cold overnight temps have preserved our deepening base keeping ski conditions chalky and fast. Finish off your Sunday with some leftovers lurking in the trees or just enjoy some cruisers in the sunshine. It will be a beautiful day in the Tetons! -MB",
        "yesterday": "6 AM- The weekend is finally here, so come treat yourself right. We squeezed out a sneaky three-inch touch-up overnight, guaranteeing you a Saturday shred of pure powder delight. Lingering flurries will fizzle this morning, leaving behind partly cloudy skies by midday. Seasonable temperatures will reach just into the teens atop Rendezvous Mountain while the Village climbs its way into the upper 20s. An added chill will come from light to moderate northwest winds breezing in the 5-25 mph range. Weekends were made to destroy the mundane. So, get out here! Because whether your game is found deep in the fluffy domain or you just want to rip a fresh corduroy lane, we've got the sensations that'll send you happily insane. -Lege"
