        "today": "6 AM- Roll outta bed and get ready for a tranquil Tuesday in the Tetons. It's gonna be a day of sparkling sunflakes and snowshine as bluebird skies brushed with a few clouds frame the terrain. A solid temperature inversion is in place this morning, so get high early and bask in the golden radiation. Post-inversion eradication, the highs will reach near 30 at the summit and well into the 30s in Teton Village. A light to moderate breeze from the northwest will help cool things down a bit, as it blows in the 5-20 mph neighborhood. Don't condemn yourself to a life of logical limits. A new personal tour of discovery leaves the Tram dock every ten minutes. Just follow your subtle intuition because the main mission of the mountain is bringing unknown dreams to fruition. -Lege",
        "yesterday": "6AM - Good Monday morning, Jackson Hole! Today's mountain conditions will look a lot like yesterday's. Expect chalky, fast groomers during the morning hours, with some cold-preserved pockets of powder awaiting harvest on north aspects. Ample sunshine will accompany Westerlys that'll hold steady around 10mph with gusts up  to 34 mph possible. This morning's inversion will break eventually and give way to a high of 35 at the base and 27 up high. Enjoy! -OH"
