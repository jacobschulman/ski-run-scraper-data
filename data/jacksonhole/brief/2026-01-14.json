        "today": "6 AM—Greetings on the start of another gorgeous day, Jackson. Ride high on the Tram this morning to get above the cool inverted temperatures. Take a second to scarf down a tasty waffle or two. Then let the substantial sunshine refracting from the frozen landscape spike the luminosity of your soul as you navigate the sugar-filled nooks of Rendezvous Bowl. High temperatures will eventually reach near 30 at the summit and into the mid-30s in the Village. Northwest winds will be light on most of the mountain but gust near 30 mph along the ridgelines. Mellow your midweek mind with a little bit of skiing. You never know what you'll find. Sometimes it's ultra-seductive and sometimes more sedating, but every single time it's sure to be a sick thing. -Lege",
        "yesterday": "6 AM- Roll outta bed and get ready for a tranquil Tuesday in the Tetons. It's gonna be a day of sparkling sunflakes and snowshine as bluebird skies brushed with a few clouds frame the terrain. A solid temperature inversion is in place this morning, so get high early and bask in the golden radiation. Post-inversion eradication, the highs will reach near 30 at the summit and well into the 30s in Teton Village. A light to moderate breeze from the northwest will help cool things down a bit, as it blows in the 5-20 mph neighborhood. Don't condemn yourself to a life of logical limits. A new personal tour of discovery leaves the Tram dock every ten minutes. Just follow your subtle intuition because the main mission of the mountain is bringing unknown dreams to fruition. -Lege"
