        "today": "6 AM—Rub the sleep dirt out of your bleary eyes and get prepared for alpine sun-sations that will leave you feeling utterly mesmerized. Bluebird skies and mild temperatures will once again play host to your dopamine dreams. Following a morning inversion, highs will peak near 30 at the summit and in the mid-30s down in Teton Village. A few stray clouds blown by light to moderate northwest winds will brush the sky, just enough to add a little texture to the terrain. Now, let's be honest. It can no longer be debated. The skiing addiction will not be satiated. So, it seems somewhere out there on the slopes is where our future's fated. -Lege",
        "yesterday": "6 AM—Greetings on the start of another gorgeous day, Jackson. Ride high on the Tram this morning to get above the cool inverted temperatures. Take a second to scarf down a tasty waffle or two. Then let the substantial sunshine refracting from the frozen landscape spike the luminosity of your soul as you navigate the sugar-filled nooks of Rendezvous Bowl. High temperatures will eventually reach near 30 at the summit and into the mid-30s in the Village. Northwest winds will be light on most of the mountain but gust near 30 mph along the ridgelines. Mellow your midweek mind with a little bit of skiing. You never know what you'll find. Sometimes it's ultra-seductive and sometimes more sedating, but every single time it's sure to be a sick thing. -Lege"
