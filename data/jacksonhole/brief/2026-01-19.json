        "today": "6 AM—Dawn is once again breaking in a tranquil fashion, so head for the Tram and feed your frozen-fractal passion. The photons will continue to fall unabated through cerulean skies as gentle northwest winds kiss the slopes. Highs will top out in the teens on the deck of Corbet's Cabin while the Village makes its way into the mid- to upper 20s. Whether you're locked in on a mission, looking to ride the frozen rail, or just out to cruise and let your wild imagination sail. All you have to do is take a slide down Rendezvous; there's absolutely no way you can fail. -Lege",
        "yesterday": "6 AM—A very happy Sunday to all skiers and riders! We're looking a chilly chalky morning with blue bird skies as far as the eye can see. Nary a cloud is anticipated today as the sun rises over the Gros Ventres. Generally light winds out of the west today with some moderate gusts possible during the afternoon hours. Temps will rise to 30 degrees at the base are while the higher elevations stick around the mid-teens. We hope to see you soaking up the sun and laying down turns today - enjoy! - OH"
