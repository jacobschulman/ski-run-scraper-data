        "today": "6 AM—Greetings, Jackson Hole. Get out of that warm, cozy bed and come for a cool mountain shred. Invading cloud cover will battle against the blue sky today, potentially squeezing out a stray flake or two along the way. While actual accumulation isn't really expected, the increase in energy from the mere sight will surely be detected. Chilly mountain temperatures will keep the snow dry and reactive to your touch, as the highs stall out in the low teens atop Rendezvous Mountain and just under 30 in the Village. Gusty west winds will blow between 5 and 25 mph, with the potential for summit gusts near 40. It doesn't matter if you're tinkering on Teewinot or getting bold on Bivouac; skiing is sure to supply everything your searching soul could lack. -Lege",
        "yesterday": "6 AM—Dawn is once again breaking in a tranquil fashion, so head for the Tram and feed your frozen-fractal passion. The photons will continue to fall unabated through cerulean skies as gentle northwest winds kiss the slopes. Highs will top out in the teens on the deck of Corbet's Cabin while the Village makes its way into the mid- to upper 20s. Whether you're locked in on a mission, looking to ride the frozen rail, or just out to cruise and let your wild imagination sail. All you have to do is take a slide down Rendezvous; there's absolutely no way you can fail. -Lege"
