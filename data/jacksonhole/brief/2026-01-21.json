        "today": "6 AM— Settle in to the subtle but seductive vibe of the midweek as we dash around the mountain like little kids engrossed in a sneaky game of hide-n-seek. Tiny treasures and tasty textures will be easy to find thanks to the illumination of mostly sunny skies. Inverted morning temperatures will eventually flip, with the summit stalling out in the teens and Teton Village rising into the upper 20s. Expect the winds to be a bit gentler today with a light to moderate western breeze between 5 and 15 mph. It's time to check out from our toxic society and leave those \"real-world\" woes behind. Explore the outer reaches of crystal-carving creativity and see what wonders you can find. -Lege",
        "yesterday": "6 AM—Greetings, Jackson Hole. Get out of that warm, cozy bed and come for a cool mountain shred. Invading cloud cover will battle against the blue sky today, potentially squeezing out a stray flake or two along the way. While actual accumulation isn't really expected, the increase in energy from the mere sight will surely be detected. Chilly mountain temperatures will keep the snow dry and reactive to your touch, as the highs stall out in the low teens atop Rendezvous Mountain and just under 30 in the Village. Gusty west winds will blow between 5 and 25 mph, with the potential for summit gusts near 40. It doesn't matter if you're tinkering on Teewinot or getting bold on Bivouac; skiing is sure to supply everything your searching soul could lack. -Lege"
