        "today": "6 AM— Thursday dawns with some clouds preparing to crest the horizon ahead of a full day of dancing across our blue sky. The passing shadows that they drop will land on perfectly manicured slopes, weaving through an endless array of off-trail textures. Cool mountain temperatures and gentle winds will keep the crystals you kick up hovering overhead a little extra long today. Prepare for highs that top out in the teens outside Corbet's Cabin and in the mid- to upper 20s in the Village. West-northwest winds will breeze through between zip and 15 mph. Come out and cleanse your cluttered mind's interior design with a hefty dose of the genuine sunflakes and snowshine. -Lege",
        "yesterday": "6 AM— Settle in to the subtle but seductive vibe of the midweek as we dash around the mountain like little kids engrossed in a sneaky game of hide-n-seek. Tiny treasures and tasty textures will be easy to find thanks to the illumination of mostly sunny skies. Inverted morning temperatures will eventually flip, with the summit stalling out in the teens and Teton Village rising into the upper 20s. Expect the winds to be a bit gentler today with a light to moderate western breeze between 5 and 15 mph. It's time to check out from our toxic society and leave those \"real-world\" woes behind. Explore the outer reaches of crystal-carving creativity and see what wonders you can find. -Lege"
