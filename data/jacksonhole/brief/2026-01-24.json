        "today": "6 AM— Up and at 'em, Jackson, because the weekend won't wait. Indigo skies will deliver potent sun-sations through the midday hours, when a few scattered clouds will start to infiltrate the scene. Cold temperatures will keep the snow surfaces dry and the vapor trails swirling high as they stall out in the single digits up at Corbet's Cabin and in the teens down in the Village. A chilly northwest breeze will cool things a little further, as it blows in the 5-15 mph neighborhood. Classic corduroy is always an inviting option, but top-secret smooth spots and soft shadow moments are currently weaving through the in-betweens. Search some out and let your rational mind be blasted to smithereens. -Lege",
        "yesterday": "6 AM— A recently unfamiliar sight greets our weary early morning eyes, Jackson, as cloud cover enshrouds the mountain. Cooling temperatures may even squeeze a stray snow shower or two out of the clouds before they dissipate this afternoon. It's going to be a good day to warm up with a waffle before you shred, as high temperatures will top out barely in the double digits on the deck of Corbet's Cabin and in the low 20s in the Village. The winds will be on the docile side, breezing out of the west between zero and no more than 15 mph. Don't fear the specter of flat-light firmpack. Feel free to unleash your wildest alpine attacks because our crack grooming crew has created miles of forgiving and smooth tracks. -Lege"
