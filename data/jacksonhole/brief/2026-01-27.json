You'll want an extra layer or two if you plan to enjoy today's bounty, especially during the morning hours with single digit temps sticking around until just before noon. Mostly clear skies will provide ample sunshine to light your way before clouds build back up in the evening hours. Breezy winds prevailing from the West are forecast to be 10-20mph with gusts of 30mph+ possible along ridgetops. Afternoon temps will be in the low 20s at the base and stick in the teens higher up. We hope to see you here! - Orion"
