        "today": "6 AM—Good morning, Jackson Hole. A quickly dissipating cloud cover greets the morning sun to start the day, but before long a near bluebird sky will be on display. By late morning, you can expect the vitamin D will have you feeling fine, as just a few scattered clouds saunter across the skyline. High temperatures will climb their way into the upper teens at the summit and near the 30-degree mark in Teton Village. A gentle western breeze will join in the show as they blow through in the 5 to 15 mph range. If you're feeling a bit lost and need perspective shifted, you don't need to be some kind of Zen-gifted whiz kid. Just hop on the aerial tram to get both physically and mentally lifted. -Lege",
        "yesterday": "6am - With back to back days of 1\" reported at JHMR, it feels like dry January was all a dream. You'll want an extra layer or two if you plan to enjoy today's bounty, especially during the morning hours with single digit temps sticking around until just before noon. Mostly clear skies will provide ample sunshine to light your way before clouds build back up in the evening hours. Breezy winds prevailing from the West are forecast to be 10-20mph with gusts of 30mph+ possible along ridgetops. Afternoon temps will be in the low 20s at the base and stick in the teens higher up. We hope to see you here! - Orion"
