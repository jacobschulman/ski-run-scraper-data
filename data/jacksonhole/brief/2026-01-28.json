        "today": "6 AM—Pssst. Hey. Wakey, wakey! We've got a welcome little change in the air for your Wednesday. Early morning sunshine will yield to encroaching cloud cover before midday, so come quick and you may catch a couple rays. But, even if you miss 'em, stick around. Because before too long, some cool frosty flakes should be coming down. High temperatures will top out near 20 at the summit and in the upper 20s down in the Village. Winds should remain on the light side, breezing out of the west in the 5-15 mph range. Head for the slopes without fear or hesitation. Because the time has come to get a little zesty with the forces of gravitation, as a sacrificial offering to the atmosphere for an extra hefty powder application. - Lege",
        "yesterday": "6 AM—Good morning, Jackson Hole. A quickly dissipating cloud cover greets the morning sun to start the day, but before long a near bluebird sky will be on display. By late morning, you can expect the vitamin D will have you feeling fine, as just a few scattered clouds saunter across the skyline. High temperatures will climb their way into the upper teens at the summit and near the 30-degree mark in Teton Village. A gentle western breeze will join in the show as they blow through in the 5 to 15 mph range. If you're feeling a bit lost and need perspective shifted, you don't need to be some kind of Zen-gifted whiz kid. Just hop on the aerial tram to get both physically and mentally lifted. -Lege"
