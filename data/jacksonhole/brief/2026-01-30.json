Freshly softened corduroy carpeting will guide you through a nicely refurbished alpine landscape. Continue your smooth cruise or dip off-piste into the mad world of micro-powder pockets. Dramatic skies will feature bright solar beams breaking through a perforated cloud cover. Comfortable high temperatures will top out near 20 at the summit while Teton Village makes its way toward the 30-degree mark. A refreshing west-northwest breeze will blow in the 5 to 15 mph neighborhood. When it comes to societal productivity, skiing probably isn't the best activity. But it's by far the greatest way to escape from toxic cultural captivity. -Lege",
