        "today": "Good Morning, Jackson Hole! Today will feel quite similar to yesterday with skies partially obstructed as high cirrus clouds push across the area. Temps will continue to sit above average with a high of 34 at the base and 32 up high. Gusty northwest winds could hit 35 mph during the morning hours, but are expected to mellow out later in this afternoon. We might not have the pow, but the terrain remains exceptional and our groomers are the envy of the Rockies. Join us to ski those Monday blues away! - OH  ",
        "yesterday": "Happy Sunday! As the weekend unfolds look for morning sunshine to decrease as cloud cover moves into the valley as the day progresses. Light to moderate winds will be trending out of the WSW at 10-15 MPH with moderate gusting into the 20 MPH range. Warming temperatures will reach the low 30's up at the Corbet's Cabin waffle factory while the valley floor will reach the high 30's by late afternoon. Cold morning conditions will ski fast and continue to soften as the day warms up. Your Sunday fun day starts with a trip to the Top Of The World and finishes with a choose your own adventure down Rendezvous' finest! Stay safe out there. - MB  "
