Temps will continue to sit above average with a high of 34 at the base and 32 up high. Gusty northwest winds could hit 35 mph during the morning hours, but are expected to mellow out later in this afternoon. We might not have the pow, but the terrain remains exceptional and our groomers are the envy of the Rockies. Join us to ski those Monday blues away! - OH  ",
