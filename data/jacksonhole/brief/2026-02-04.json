        "today": "6 AM—Greetings, Jackson Hole. Tuesday is dawning with Rendezvous' upper slopes partially enshrouded in flurry-producing cloud cover, giving the mountain an alluring air of mysterium. Hop onto the tram and let your mind unwind in a moment of transitory delirium. The trippy cloud vapors and fast-passing showers will dissipate as the day rolls on, leaving mostly sunny skies for the afternoon. Warm temperatures will rise into the mid- to upper 20s at the summit and the upper 30s in Teton Village. Moderate northwest winds will keep those highs feeling a bit cooler as they blow between 5 and 25 mph. Don't feel bad if you succumb to dopamine's temptation. Just focus on the building buzz of sheer big-mountain elation. -Lege",
