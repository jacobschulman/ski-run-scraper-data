        "today": "6 AM—Pop out of bed, Jackson. The fat old sun is on the rise, and it's time for you to come play. Because a bluebird blast of vitamin D is a surefire way to skyrocket you over any hump day. A few high clouds here and there may drop a diffused shadow or two, but be prepared to strip a layer, as warm temperatures will zoar to around 30 outside Corbet's Cabin while Teton Village toys with the 40-degree mark. A gentle northwest breeze will only be able to cool things off a tiny bit, as it wafts through at no more than 10 mph. When you feel the flow take hold, drop your inhibitions fast and give an enthusiastic shout. Because even if the future is already fated, it's still a wicked blast getting to live it out. -Lege",
        "yesterday": "6 AM—Greetings, Jackson Hole. Tuesday is dawning with Rendezvous' upper slopes partially enshrouded in flurry-producing cloud cover, giving the mountain an alluring air of mysterium. Hop onto the tram and let your mind unwind in a moment of transitory delirium. The trippy cloud vapors and fast-passing showers will dissipate as the day rolls on, leaving mostly sunny skies for the afternoon. Warm temperatures will rise into the mid- to upper 20s at the summit and the upper 30s in Teton Village. Moderate northwest winds will keep those highs feeling a bit cooler as they blow between 5 and 25 mph. Don't feel bad if you succumb to dopamine's temptation. Just focus on the building buzz of sheer big-mountain elation. -Lege"
