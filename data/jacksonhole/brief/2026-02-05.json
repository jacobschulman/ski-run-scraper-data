        "today": "6 AM—Up and at 'em, Jackson. Attempting to deny the mountain's draw is an exercise in fall-line futility. So, slather on some sunscreen and get ready to spend the day snow-sailing the seas of Teton Tranquility. Solar rays will fall unabated through indigo skies, warming the atmosphere as they refract and radiate off the snowpack. Following a morning inversion, highs will make their way well into the 30s at the summit and into the mid 40s in the Village. Winds will be of the light and variable variety, highlighting the mellow vibe. Come out and cruise where the only power you need is gravitational. Whether your approach is recreational or that of a seasoned professional, the outcome is always something sensational. -Lege",
        "yesterday": "6 AM—Pop out of bed, Jackson. The fat old sun is on the rise, and it's time for you to come play. Because a bluebird blast of vitamin D is a surefire way to skyrocket you over any hump day. A few high clouds here and there may drop a diffused shadow or two, but be prepared to strip a layer, as warm temperatures will zoar to around 30 outside Corbet's Cabin while Teton Village toys with the 40-degree mark. A gentle northwest breeze will only be able to cool things off a tiny bit, as it wafts through at no more than 10 mph. When you feel the flow take hold, drop your inhibitions fast and give an enthusiastic shout. Because even if the future is already fated, it's still a wicked blast getting to live it out. -Lege"
