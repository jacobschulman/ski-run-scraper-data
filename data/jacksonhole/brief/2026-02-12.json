Beware that periods of heavy accumulations can push you towards a full-blown case of \"Deep Snow-cosis,\" the only cure for which is an extended treatment of white-room hypnosis. High temperatures will peak in the low 20s atop Rendezvous Mountain and reach the upper 30s in Teton Village. The fresh flying flakes will be blown by steady southwest winds between 5 and 15 mph. We've been jiggling the key to the powder padlock, and it finally spun. So, don't delay; it's time for some gluttonous big-mountain fun. -Lege\n ",
