        "today": "6 AM—Shazaaam! Over the past 24 hours, 16 inches of high-grade pow performed a big-mountain makeover on the one we call Rendezvous. So, pound that morning coffee quick, because you know what to do. Head for the tram prepared for warm temperatures that top out in the low 20s on the deck of the Corbet's Cabin Factory of Waffle Delights and near 40 degrees down in the Village. Lingering snow showers may pop off from a slightly perforated cloud cover that also allows a few sunflakes to fall. Mellow winds will swing out of the west between 5 and 15 mph. Now it may seem like the obvious way to go, but in an effort to not recycle some old deep-pow rhyme, I instead will leave you with a salute to the magic of extended hangtime. That blissful slow-mo moment of freedom in the air that punctuates your alpine trip from anywhere to everywhere. -Lege\n ",
        "yesterday": "6 AM—Hit your hump day with enthusiasm and speed, and let sweet storm-skiing satisfy your every need. 2\" of high-grade pow has already slathered the slopes this morning, and more is expected to drop through the day. Beware that periods of heavy accumulations can push you towards a full-blown case of \"Deep Snow-cosis,\" the only cure for which is an extended treatment of white-room hypnosis. High temperatures will peak in the low 20s atop Rendezvous Mountain and reach the upper 30s in Teton Village. The fresh flying flakes will be blown by steady southwest winds between 5 and 15 mph. We've been jiggling the key to the powder padlock, and it finally spun. So, don't delay; it's time for some gluttonous big-mountain fun. -Lege\n "
