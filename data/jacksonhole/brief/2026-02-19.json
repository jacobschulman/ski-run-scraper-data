        "today": "6 AM—Greetings, Jackson Hole. Pop outta that bed and come enjoy the lingering effects of yesterday's fantastic storm. 6\" fell on Rendezvous Mountain over the past 24 hours, with 1 of those settling after the lifts closed. Scattershot snow showers will continue to put the finishing touches on the storm total through the morning hours before giving way to some infiltrating sunbeams this afternoon. You might want to stop in to Corbet's Cabin for a warm waffle, because powder-preserving temperatures are going to top out in the single digits at the summit and in the low 20s down in Teton Village. Light to moderate west-southwest winds will keep your vapor trails swirling as they clock in between 5 and 25 mph. Don't feel like your exuberance is something to conceal when so many snowy treasures abound. The elevated euphoria is real, so give a shout and let the universe know every time another one is found. -Lege",
        "yesterday": "6 AM—Wake up and walk into a world of white where all your trivial midweek cares fade far out of sight. 9 inches of fresh fell on Rendezvous Mountain over the past 24 hours, with more than half landing post-lift closure. But that's just the beginning; because periods of powfall will continue to pile until the day is over. The cold-smoking clouds you kick up will be swirling high, blown by light to moderate southwest winds in the 5 to 20 mph range. High temperatures begin a slight cooling trend today, with the summit stalling out in the teens and Teton Village right around the freezing mark. Entertain every crazy thought that may invade and embark on a frosty mountain escapade. Just beware, you could lose your mind. Because deep in the whiteroom it's nearly impossible to find. -Lege"
