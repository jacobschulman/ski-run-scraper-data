        "today": "6 AM—Greetings, Jackson Hole. Tuesday is dawning with Rendezvous' upper slopes partially enshrouded in flurry-producing cloud cover, giving the mountain an alluring air of mysterium. Hop onto the tram and let your mind unwind in a moment of transitory delirium. The trippy cloud vapors and fast-passing showers will dissipate as the day rolls on, leaving mostly sunny skies for the afternoon. Warm temperatures will rise into the mid- to upper 20s at the summit and the upper 30s in Teton Village. Moderate northwest winds will keep those highs feeling a bit cooler as they blow between 5 and 25 mph. Don't feel bad if you succumb to dopamine's temptation. Just focus on the building buzz of sheer big-mountain elation. -Lege",
        "yesterday": "Good Morning, Jackson Hole! Today will feel quite similar to yesterday with skies partially obstructed as high cirrus clouds push across the area. Temps will continue to sit above average with a high of 34 at the base and 32 up high. Gusty northwest winds could hit 35 mph during the morning hours, but are expected to mellow out later in this afternoon. We might not have the pow, but the terrain remains exceptional and our groomers are the envy of the Rockies. Join us to ski those Monday blues away! - OH  "
