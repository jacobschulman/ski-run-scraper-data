        "today": "6 AM—Alright, alright, a Valentine's Day snuggle is certainly fun, but it's time to get up and make a few runs. A blazing blue sky and some sultry clouds will be slow-mingling overhead, dropping both sunshine and shadows on the crystal dance floor below. Things will heat up to near 20 degrees at the summit as the Village flirts with the 40-degree mark. So, grab someone special and head on out for a snowy skylark. Finally, a gentle wind from the west will kiss the slopes in the 5-15 mph range. Snow, sunshine, and a seductive passing smile can conspire to set your secret passions on fire. Don't try to fight the forbidden temptation; embrace the exhilaration and succumb to the hidden desire. -Lege",
        "yesterday": "6 AM—Up and at 'em, Jackson! It's Friday the 13th, but instead of slasher movie chills, we're conjuring up a fun-filled day of big-mountain thrills as the Rendezvous Royalty throw down for the claim of Corbet's Couloir supremacy. The weather will be sweet for both shredding and spectating, so head on out and do a little bit of both. Partly cloudy skies will conspire with highs near 20 at the summit and in the upper 30s down in Teton Village to create a wide variety of snow types for you to explore. Gentle winds will guide you on your way as they breeze between zip and 15 mph. At the end of the day, whether it's your first experience on skis or you wore them in the womb, don't forget: we're all really kings and queens when we test the limits of our personal extremes. -Lege"
