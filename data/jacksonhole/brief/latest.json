        "today": "Sunday kicks off in clear and sunny fashion with cloud cover increasing by late afternoon as a highly anticipated storm system moves into our area by tonight. Moderate winds will be trending out of the WSW at 12-20 MPH with afternoon gusts reaching 30 MPH. The ski conditions will start off firm and fast in the morning and will soften up by early afternoon as warming temperatures reach the low 30's at the top of the Tram, while Teton Village hits the mid-40's by closing bell. Whether you are looking to put some stripes on your favorite run through the woods or out for a Sunday cruise, Rendezvous Mountain will pack a little something in for everyone today. Keep those ski boots dancing as the storm approaches. Stay safe out there! -MB  ",
        "yesterday": "6 AM—Time to get up, Jackson Hole. Sure, it's Saturday, and you could easily take it chill and mild. But why not tap into your inner child by letting all your fall-line fantasies run totally wild? Morning clouds with the slim potential for a passing snow shower will add an air of mystery unseen as of late on the slopes of Teton Village before quickly giving way to beams of afternoon sunshine. High temperatures will tickle the freezing point at the summit and rise to the low 40s down in the Village. Light to moderate winds will shift out of the west as they blow in the 5-20 mph neighborhood. Now, I'm not going to pretend that every slope you descend will lead to a place where your ego can transcend. But as it's often been said, the fool who persists in his folly gets wise in the end. -Lege"
