        "today": "6 AM—Good morning, Jackson Hole. A quickly dissipating cloud cover greets the morning sun to start the day, but before long a near bluebird sky will be on display. By late morning, you can expect the vitamin D will have you feeling fine, as just a few scattered clouds saunter across the skyline. High temperatures will climb their way into the upper teens at the summit and near the 30-degree mark in Teton Village. A gentle western breeze will join in the show as they blow through in the 5 to 15 mph range. If you're feeling a bit lost and need perspective shifted, you don't need to be some kind of Zen-gifted whiz kid. Just hop on the aerial tram to get both physically and mentally lifted. -Lege",
