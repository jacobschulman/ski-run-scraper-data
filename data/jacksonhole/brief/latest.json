        "today": "6AM - Well, it looks like Old Man Winter decided to show up (which is more than we can say for some offensive lines). Whether you're looking to celebrate or forget your troubles, one thing is for sure: storm skiing is the perfect pairing for your Monday aspirations.  Light to moderate snow will fall most of the day with up to an inch per hour falling over Tetons above 8,500 ft. Today's much needed precipitation will be accompanied by strong winds out of the West with gusts up to 60mph possible across ridges and peaks. Temperatures will cool slightly from their morning highs - 36 degrees at the base and 25 degrees at the summit for mid-day projections. Break out the gore-tex and meet us on the slopes! -Orion",
        "yesterday": "Sunday kicks off in clear and sunny fashion with cloud cover increasing by late afternoon as a highly anticipated storm system moves into our area by tonight. Moderate winds will be trending out of the WSW at 12-20 MPH with afternoon gusts reaching 30 MPH. The ski conditions will start off firm and fast in the morning and will soften up by early afternoon as warming temperatures reach the low 30's at the top of the Tram, while Teton Village hits the mid-40's by closing bell. Whether you are looking to put some stripes on your favorite run through the woods or out for a Sunday cruise, Rendezvous Mountain will pack a little something in for everyone today. Keep those ski boots dancing as the storm approaches. Stay safe out there! -MB  "
