        "today": "6 AM—Up and at 'em, Jackson. Attempting to deny the mountain's draw is an exercise in fall-line futility. So, slather on some sunscreen and get ready to spend the day snow-sailing the seas of Teton Tranquility. Solar rays will fall unabated through indigo skies, warming the atmosphere as they refract and radiate off the snowpack. Following a morning inversion, highs will make their way well into the 30s at the summit and into the mid 40s in the Village. Winds will be of the light and variable variety, highlighting the mellow vibe. Come out and cruise where the only power you need is gravitational. Whether your approach is recreational or that of a seasoned professional, the outcome is always something sensational. -Lege",
