        "today": "6AM - Abraham Lincoln once said: \"Give me 6 hours to ski and I'll spend the first 4 hours sharpening my edges!\" We're not sure this is great advice, but we sleep easy knowing Honest Abe loved to shred as much as we do. Happy Presidents' Day everyone - we're looking at another relatively dry and mild day before the next storm system moves into the area. That storm is pushing winds ahead of it - ridgetop gusts are expected to top out at 40mph today. The base area will be balmy with an anticipated high of 43 degrees while summit temps should hover in the mid-20s. That next system moves in tonight, bringing with it a good chance of moderate snow and more seasonable temperatures. Happy Holidays everyone! - Orion",
        "yesterday": "Start your Sunday off with some morning sunshine and a dose of Rendezvous Mountain's finest. Look for mostly sunny skies today with periods of sporadic cloud cover moving through the valley.  Calm to light winds will be trending out of the SW at 15-17 MPH with ridgetop gusts reaching up to 26 MPH. Mountain temperatures will start off cold and rise into the low 20's in the higher elevations while the base area on the valley floor will hit the low 40's by mid-afternoon. Cold overnight temps will keep the ski conditions fast and chalky up high while the mid-mountain terrain will soften up by early afternoon. Now that the King's and Queen's have shown us what's possible, come practice your craft on our high mountain playground! Stay safe. -MB "
