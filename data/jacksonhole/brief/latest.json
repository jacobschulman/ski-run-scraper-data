        "today": "6 AM—Up and at 'em, Jackson! It's Friday the 13th, but instead of slasher movie chills, we're conjuring up a fun-filled day of big-mountain thrills as the Rendezvous Royalty throw down for the claim of Corbet's Couloir supremacy. The weather will be sweet for both shredding and spectating, so head on out and do a little bit of both. Partly cloudy skies will conspire with highs near 20 at the summit and in the upper 30s down in Teton Village to create a wide variety of snow types for you to explore. Gentle winds will guide you on your way as they breeze between zip and 15 mph. At the end of the day, whether it's your first experience on skis or you wore them in the womb, don't forget: we're all really kings and queens when we test the limits of our personal extremes. -Lege",
        "yesterday": "6 AM—Shazaaam! Over the past 24 hours, 16 inches of high-grade pow performed a big-mountain makeover on the one we call Rendezvous. So, pound that morning coffee quick, because you know what to do. Head for the tram prepared for warm temperatures that top out in the low 20s on the deck of the Corbet's Cabin Factory of Waffle Delights and near 40 degrees down in the Village. Lingering snow showers may pop off from a slightly perforated cloud cover that also allows a few sunflakes to fall. Mellow winds will swing out of the west between 5 and 15 mph. Now it may seem like the obvious way to go, but in an effort to not recycle some old deep-pow rhyme, I instead will leave you with a salute to the magic of extended hangtime. That blissful slow-mo moment of freedom in the air that punctuates your alpine trip from anywhere to everywhere. -Lege\n "
