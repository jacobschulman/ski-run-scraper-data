        "today": "Start your Sunday off with some morning sunshine and a dose of Rendezvous Mountain's finest. Look for mostly sunny skies today with periods of sporadic cloud cover moving through the valley.  Calm to light winds will be trending out of the SW at 15-17 MPH with ridgetop gusts reaching up to 26 MPH. Mountain temperatures will start off cold and rise into the low 20's in the higher elevations while the base area on the valley floor will hit the low 40's by mid-afternoon. Cold overnight temps will keep the ski conditions fast and chalky up high while the mid-mountain terrain will soften up by early afternoon. Now that the King's and Queen's have shown us what's possible, come practice your craft on our high mountain playground! Stay safe. -MB ",
        "yesterday": "6 AM—Alright, alright, a Valentine's Day snuggle is certainly fun, but it's time to get up and make a few runs. A blazing blue sky and some sultry clouds will be slow-mingling overhead, dropping both sunshine and shadows on the crystal dance floor below. Things will heat up to near 20 degrees at the summit as the Village flirts with the 40-degree mark. So, grab someone special and head on out for a snowy skylark. Finally, a gentle wind from the west will kiss the slopes in the 5-15 mph range. Snow, sunshine, and a seductive passing smile can conspire to set your secret passions on fire. Don't try to fight the forbidden temptation; embrace the exhilaration and succumb to the hidden desire. -Lege"
