  "conditions": "6 AM- Pop outta bed and head for the Village, because the lull in the weather just won't wait. After a 3-inch daytime touch-up in the higher elevations yesterday, we stand poised for a cooler, full mountain punch of precipitation today. Pockets of powfall could break out at any moment on the slopes and will increase in intensity as the day flows. Gusty southwest winds will pick up as well, eventually cranking in the 10-40 mph range. Expect high temperatures to stall out in the low 20s at the summit and the upper 30s in the base area. By now excited powder-senses should have you tingling more than a three-ring show from the Brothers Ringling. The atmospheric energy is building, and the eggnog's gone. So, come clown around and do a little slope-side mingling. -Lege",
