  "conditions": "The storm has passed after depositing another 7\" across the slopes of Rendezvous Mountain keeping our Upper Mountain ski conditions in prime form. Yesterday's high winds have buffed certain aspects to perfection. Today will have clear and sunny skies throughout, with calm to light winds trending out of the NW at 5-12 MPH. Cold temperatures have moved in with the sunshine to help preserve our deepening base. The Top of The World will see temps max out in the low single digits while the valley floor will reach the mid-teens by late afternoon. Come and celebrate the final Sunday of the year with some fun in the sun and give those early season legs a workout. Today will be a beauty! -MB",
