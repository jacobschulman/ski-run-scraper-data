Clouds will be building through the day in prelude to afternoon snow showers. Mild highs will hang in the upper 20s on the deck of Corbet's Cabin and push into the mid-30s down in the Village. Gentle winds from the west-southwest will slowly usher in this year's inaugural storm as they breeze through between 5 and 10 mph. So, prepare to join in on our next powder-plundering revolution. Let this afternoon's incoming crystals be the inspirational catalyst for your next resolution. Because regardless of affliction, fresh falling snow is the ultimate solution. -Lege",
