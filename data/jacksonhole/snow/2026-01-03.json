  "conditions": "6 AM- Greetings, Jackson Hole. It's the first weekend of 2026, and we're here to supply your latest big-mountain fix. Following four warm inches of pow and a little wind whippin', we've got something for everyone sprinkled in the mix. Clouds and sunshine will dance across the sky, taking turns at the lead. Come equipped for mild temperatures that tickle the 30-degree mark at the summit and 40 in Teton Village. South to southwest winds will pick up a touch this afternoon ahead of the next round of moisture, eventually cranking between 10 and 30 mph. Since the recent weather and warmth have nearly eradicated the scratchin', sniff around. Because it's always past the next curve that your ultimate crystal destiny is found. -Lege",
