  "conditions": "The Holiday weekend closes out with another 5\" of fresh snow since lifts closed yesterday. The high mountain terrain has been refreshed and awaits your inspection on this first Sunday of the year. Look for cloudy skies bringing more snowfall throughout the morning and then moving into mixed precipitation by early afternoon. Temperatures will hover in the low to mid-20's at the summit while the base area will reach the upper 30's by lunchtime. Moderate winds will be trending out of the WSW at 12-20 MPH with some afternoon gusts up near 30 MPH. The new snow will be creamy, and the high elevations will be offering up delicious Sunday treats. Come out for a snack! -MB",
