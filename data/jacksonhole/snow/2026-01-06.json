  "conditions": "6 AM- Ladies and gentlemen, children of all ages, prepare for an alpine experience that's guaranteed to be totally outrageous. 7 more inches of wind-blown pow slathered the mountainside over the past 24 hours, with 3 of them buffing up the slopes after the lifts closed. Occasional breaks in the clouds will pop today, shooting solar beams between periods of continued snowfall. Mild high temperatures will tickle the low 20s in the upper elevations while the Village hangs in the low 30s. Strong winds swirling from the west will help clean the big-mountain canvas while simultaneously sending you into an extended state of vapor-derived delirium. Despite the supersonic faceshots to the chin, you'll find the fresh flakes hit as soft as an angel's wing. Yet, somehow, they still pack the power to elicit a fiendishly demonic grin. -Lege",
