  "conditions": "Keep your weekend momentum in forward motion with bluebird skies and a slight morning temperature inversion. Look for clear and sunny skies throughout the day with light to moderate winds trending out of the West. Temperatures will reach the low 20's across the high elevations while the valley floor will climb into the low to mid-30's by late afternoon. Cold overnight temps have preserved our deepening base keeping ski conditions chalky and fast. Finish off your Sunday with some leftovers lurking in the trees or just enjoy some cruisers in the sunshine. It will be a beautiful day in the Tetons! -MB",
