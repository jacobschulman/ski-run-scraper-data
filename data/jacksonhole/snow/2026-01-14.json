  "conditions": "6 AM—Greetings on the start of another gorgeous day, Jackson. Ride high on the Tram this morning to get above the cool inverted temperatures. Take a second to scarf down a tasty waffle or two. Then let the substantial sunshine refracting from the frozen landscape spike the luminosity of your soul as you navigate the sugar-filled nooks of Rendezvous Bowl. High temperatures will eventually reach near 30 at the summit and into the mid-30s in the Village. Northwest winds will be light on most of the mountain but gust near 30 mph along the ridgelines. Mellow your midweek mind with a little bit of skiing. You never know what you'll find. Sometimes it's ultra-seductive and sometimes more sedating, but every single time it's sure to be a sick thing. -Lege",
