  "conditions": "6 AM—Welcome to the weekend, all you fall-line fanatics. It's time to harness a little bit of \"get up and go\" because the classic combo of an indigo sky above surreal, wind-sculpted snow is poised to put on another alpine light show. Whether you're totally green or somewhere beyond advanced, the draw of Rendezvous' refracted solar rays will leave you feeling oddly entranced. Cool mountain temperatures will top out around 20 outside Corbet's Cabin and near 30 in Teton Village. Diminishing northwest winds will largely blow in the 5-15 mph range following higher morning gusts. Ultimately, Saturdays were made for all to enjoy. So, grab whatever carving tool you prefer to employ, and let the mountain be your Gentle Giant toy. -Lege",
