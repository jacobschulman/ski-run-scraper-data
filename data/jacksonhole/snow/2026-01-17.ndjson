Panoramic vistas framed by sapphire skies await your creative daydreams as abundant sunshine continues to rule overhead. Cooler temperatures will top out in the low teens at the summit and in the mid-20s in the Village. Expect your carving contrails to linger a little longer, as moderate north-northwest winds gusting between 5 and 25 mph spin the crystals skyward. It's close enough to the weekend. So, ditch out on the oppressive workplace drudgery and let Rendezvous Mountain take you on a liberating voyage of personal discovery. -Lege","operatingStatus":{"totalLifts":13,"openLifts":0,"expectedOpenLifts":0},"snowfall":{"overnight_inches":0,"overnight_cm":0,"24hour_inches":0,"24hour_cm":0,"48hour_inches":0,"48hour_cm":0,"7day_inches":2,"7day_cm":5,"season_total_inches":217,"season_total_cm":551},"baseDepth":{"inches":49,"cm":124,"range_inches":null,"range_cm":null},"terrain":{"totalTrails":0,"openTrails":0,"groomedTrails":0,"totalLifts":0,"openLifts":0},"activities":{},"currentConditions":{"base":{"location":"Base","name":"Base","updated":null,"temperature_f":12,"temperature_c":null,"wind_direction":null,"wind_speed_mph":null,"wind_gusts_mph":null,"skies":null,"conditions":null},"midMountain":{"location":"Mid Mountain","name":"Mid Mountain","updated":null,"temperature_f":17,"temperature_c":null,"wind_direction":null,"wind_speed_mph":3,"wind_gusts_mph":null,"skies":null,"conditions":null},"summit":{"location":"Summit","name":"Summit","updated":null,"temperature_f":10,"temperature_c":null,"wind_direction":null,"wind_speed_mph":32,"wind_gusts_mph":null,"skies":null,"conditions":null},"lastUpdated":null},"forecast":null,"provider":"ikon","apiProvider":"zaneray"}
