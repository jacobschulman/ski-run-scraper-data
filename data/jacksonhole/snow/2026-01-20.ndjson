The photons will continue to fall unabated through cerulean skies as gentle northwest winds kiss the slopes. Highs will top out in the teens on the deck of Corbet's Cabin while the Village makes its way into the mid- to upper 20s. Whether you're locked in on a mission, looking to ride the frozen rail, or just out to cruise and let your wild imagination sail. All you have to do is take a slide down Rendezvous; there's absolutely no way you can fail. -Lege","operatingStatus":{"totalLifts":13,"openLifts":0,"expectedOpenLifts":0},"snowfall":{"overnight_inches":0,"overnight_cm":0,"24hour_inches":0,"24hour_cm":0,"48hour_inches":0,"48hour_cm":0,"7day_inches":0,"7day_cm":0,"season_total_inches":217,"season_total_cm":551},"baseDepth":{"inches":49,"cm":124,"range_inches":null,"range_cm":null},"terrain":{"totalTrails":0,"openTrails":0,"groomedTrails":0,"totalLifts":0,"openLifts":0},"activities":{},"currentConditions":{"base":{"location":"Base","name":"Base","updated":null,"temperature_f":8,"temperature_c":null,"wind_direction":null,"wind_speed_mph":null,"wind_gusts_mph":null,"skies":null,"conditions":null},"midMountain":{"location":"Mid Mountain","name":"Mid Mountain","updated":null,"temperature_f":16,"temperature_c":null,"wind_direction":null,"wind_speed_mph":8,"wind_gusts_mph":null,"skies":null,"conditions":null},"summit":{"location":"Summit","name":"Summit","updated":null,"temperature_f":12,"temperature_c":null,"wind_direction":null,"wind_speed_mph":18,"wind_gusts_mph":null,"skies":null,"conditions":null},"lastUpdated":null},"forecast":null,"provider":"ikon","apiProvider":"zaneray"}
