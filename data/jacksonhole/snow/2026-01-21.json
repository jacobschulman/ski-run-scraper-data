  "conditions": "6 AM— Settle in to the subtle but seductive vibe of the midweek as we dash around the mountain like little kids engrossed in a sneaky game of hide-n-seek. Tiny treasures and tasty textures will be easy to find thanks to the illumination of mostly sunny skies. Inverted morning temperatures will eventually flip, with the summit stalling out in the teens and Teton Village rising into the upper 20s. Expect the winds to be a bit gentler today with a light to moderate western breeze between 5 and 15 mph. It's time to check out from our toxic society and leave those \"real-world\" woes behind. Explore the outer reaches of crystal-carving creativity and see what wonders you can find. -Lege",
