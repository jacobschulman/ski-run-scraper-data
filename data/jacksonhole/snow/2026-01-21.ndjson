Get out of that warm, cozy bed and come for a cool mountain shred. Invading cloud cover will battle against the blue sky today, potentially squeezing out a stray flake or two along the way. While actual accumulation isn't really expected, the increase in energy from the mere sight will surely be detected. Chilly mountain temperatures will keep the snow dry and reactive to your touch, as the highs stall out in the low teens atop Rendezvous Mountain and just under 30 in the Village. Gusty west winds will blow between 5 and 25 mph, with the potential for summit gusts near 40. It doesn't matter if you're tinkering on Teewinot or getting bold on Bivouac; skiing is sure to supply everything your searching soul could lack. -Lege","operatingStatus":{"totalLifts":13,"openLifts":0,"expectedOpenLifts":0},"snowfall":{"overnight_inches":0,"overnight_cm":0,"24hour_inches":0,"24hour_cm":0,"48hour_inches":0,"48hour_cm":0,"7day_inches":0,"7day_cm":0,"season_total_inches":217,"season_total_cm":551},"baseDepth":{"inches":47,"cm":119,"range_inches":null,"range_cm":null},"terrain":{"totalTrails":0,"openTrails":0,"groomedTrails":0,"totalLifts":0,"openLifts":0},"activities":{},"currentConditions":{"base":{"location":"Base","name":"Base","updated":null,"temperature_f":19,"temperature_c":null,"wind_direction":null,"wind_speed_mph":null,"wind_gusts_mph":null,"skies":null,"conditions":null},"midMountain":{"location":"Mid Mountain","name":"Mid Mountain","updated":null,"temperature_f":16,"temperature_c":null,"wind_direction":null,"wind_speed_mph":5,"wind_gusts_mph":null,"skies":null,"conditions":null},"summit":{"location":"Summit","name":"Summit","updated":null,"temperature_f":11,"temperature_c":null,"wind_direction":null,"wind_speed_mph":16,"wind_gusts_mph":null,"skies":null,"conditions":null},"lastUpdated":null},"forecast":null,"provider":"ikon","apiProvider":"zaneray"}
