  "conditions": "6 AM— Thursday dawns with some clouds preparing to crest the horizon ahead of a full day of dancing across our blue sky. The passing shadows that they drop will land on perfectly manicured slopes, weaving through an endless array of off-trail textures. Cool mountain temperatures and gentle winds will keep the crystals you kick up hovering overhead a little extra long today. Prepare for highs that top out in the teens outside Corbet's Cabin and in the mid- to upper 20s in the Village. West-northwest winds will breeze through between zip and 15 mph. Come out and cleanse your cluttered mind's interior design with a hefty dose of the genuine sunflakes and snowshine. -Lege",
