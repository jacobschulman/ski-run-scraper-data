  "conditions": "6 AM— A recently unfamiliar sight greets our weary early morning eyes, Jackson, as cloud cover enshrouds the mountain. Cooling temperatures may even squeeze a stray snow shower or two out of the clouds before they dissipate this afternoon. It's going to be a good day to warm up with a waffle before you shred, as high temperatures will top out barely in the double digits on the deck of Corbet's Cabin and in the low 20s in the Village. The winds will be on the docile side, breezing out of the west between zero and no more than 15 mph. Don't fear the specter of flat-light firmpack. Feel free to unleash your wildest alpine attacks because our crack grooming crew has created miles of forgiving and smooth tracks. -Lege",
