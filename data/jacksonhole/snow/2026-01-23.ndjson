The passing shadows that they drop will land on perfectly manicured slopes, weaving through an endless array of off-trail textures. Cool mountain temperatures and gentle winds will keep the crystals you kick up hovering overhead a little extra long today. Prepare for highs that top out in the teens outside Corbet's Cabin and in the mid- to upper 20s in the Village. West-northwest winds will breeze through between zip and 15 mph. Come out and cleanse your cluttered mind's interior design with a hefty dose of the genuine sunflakes and snowshine. -Lege","operatingStatus":{"totalLifts":13,"openLifts":0,"expectedOpenLifts":0},"snowfall":{"overnight_inches":0,"overnight_cm":0,"24hour_inches":0,"24hour_cm":0,"48hour_inches":0,"48hour_cm":0,"7day_inches":0,"7day_cm":0,"season_total_inches":217,"season_total_cm":551},"baseDepth":{"inches":48,"cm":122,"range_inches":null,"range_cm":null},"terrain":{"totalTrails":0,"openTrails":0,"groomedTrails":0,"totalLifts":0,"openLifts":0},"activities":{},"currentConditions":{"base":{"location":"Base","name":"Base","updated":null,"temperature_f":12,"temperature_c":null,"wind_direction":null,"wind_speed_mph":null,"wind_gusts_mph":null,"skies":null,"conditions":null},"midMountain":{"location":"Mid Mountain","name":"Mid Mountain","updated":null,"temperature_f":18,"temperature_c":null,"wind_direction":null,"wind_speed_mph":1,"wind_gusts_mph":null,"skies":null,"conditions":null},"summit":{"location":"Summit","name":"Summit","updated":null,"temperature_f":10,"temperature_c":null,"wind_direction":null,"wind_speed_mph":10,"wind_gusts_mph":null,"skies":null,"conditions":null},"lastUpdated":null},"forecast":null,"provider":"ikon","apiProvider":"zaneray"}
