  "conditions": "6 AM— Up and at 'em, Jackson, because the weekend won't wait. Indigo skies will deliver potent sun-sations through the midday hours, when a few scattered clouds will start to infiltrate the scene. Cold temperatures will keep the snow surfaces dry and the vapor trails swirling high as they stall out in the single digits up at Corbet's Cabin and in the teens down in the Village. A chilly northwest breeze will cool things a little further, as it blows in the 5-15 mph neighborhood. Classic corduroy is always an inviting option, but top-secret smooth spots and soft shadow moments are currently weaving through the in-betweens. Search some out and let your rational mind be blasted to smithereens. -Lege",
