A quickly dissipating cloud cover greets the morning sun to start the day, but before long a near bluebird sky will be on display. By late morning, you can expect the vitamin D will have you feeling fine, as just a few scattered clouds saunter across the skyline. High temperatures will climb their way into the upper teens at the summit and near the 30-degree mark in Teton Village. A gentle western breeze will join in the show as they blow through in the 5 to 15 mph range. If you're feeling a bit lost and need perspective shifted, you don't need to be some kind of Zen-gifted whiz kid. Just hop on the aerial tram to get both physically and mentally lifted. -Lege","operatingStatus":{"totalLifts":13,"openLifts":0,"expectedOpenLifts":0},"snowfall":{"overnight_inches":0,"overnight_cm":0,"24hour_inches":0,"24hour_cm":0,"48hour_inches":1,"48hour_cm":3,"7day_inches":2,"7day_cm":5,"season_total_inches":218,"season_total_cm":554},"baseDepth":{"inches":48,"cm":122,"range_inches":null,"range_cm":null},"terrain":{"totalTrails":0,"openTrails":0,"groomedTrails":0,"totalLifts":0,"openLifts":0},"activities":{},"currentConditions":{"base":{"location":"Base","name":"Base","updated":null,"temperature_f":15,"temperature_c":null,"wind_direction":null,"wind_speed_mph":null,"wind_gusts_mph":null,"skies":null,"conditions":null},"midMountain":{"location":"Mid Mountain","name":"Mid Mountain","updated":null,"temperature_f":22,"temperature_c":null,"wind_direction":null,"wind_speed_mph":7,"wind_gusts_mph":null,"skies":null,"conditions":null},"summit":{"location":"Summit","name":"Summit","updated":null,"temperature_f":17,"temperature_c":null,"wind_direction":null,"wind_speed_mph":21,"wind_gusts_mph":null,"skies":null,"conditions":null},"lastUpdated":null},"forecast":null,"provider":"ikon","apiProvider":"zaneray"}
