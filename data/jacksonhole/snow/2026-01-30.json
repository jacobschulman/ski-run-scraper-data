  "conditions": "6 AM—Greetings Jackson Hole, it's Friday! Come log some vertical mileage because while the weekend is just around the corner, a mellow vibe pervades the scene. Just hop out of that bed and you'll see exactly what I mean. Broken cloud cover fills the valley alongside mild temperatures and gentle winds. Outside of the slight possibility of a passing snow shower, you can expect more of the same through the day. High temperatures will climb into the low 20s outside Corbet's Cabin and to near the freezing mark in the Village. A soft western breeze will join in the show, blowing no more than 10 mph. Ditch out early on the stationary corporate treadmill and enjoy a wild life that's moving rapidly downhill. -Lege",
