And besides, it's time to reap the large rewards from a tiny little touch-up, two inches deep. Freshly softened corduroy carpeting will guide you through a nicely refurbished alpine landscape. Continue your smooth cruise or dip off-piste into the mad world of micro-powder pockets. Dramatic skies will feature bright solar beams breaking through a perforated cloud cover. Comfortable high temperatures will top out near 20 at the summit while Teton Village makes its way toward the 30-degree mark. A refreshing west-northwest breeze will blow in the 5 to 15 mph neighborhood. When it comes to societal productivity, skiing probably isn't the best activity. But it's by far the greatest way to escape from toxic cultural captivity. -Lege","operatingStatus":{"totalLifts":13,"openLifts":0,"expectedOpenLifts":0},"snowfall":{"overnight_inches":1,"overnight_cm":3,"24hour_inches":2,"24hour_cm":5,"48hour_inches":2,"48hour_cm":5,"7day_inches":4,"7day_cm":10,"season_total_inches":219,"season_total_cm":556},"baseDepth":{"inches":48,"cm":122,"range_inches":null,"range_cm":null},"terrain":{"totalTrails":0,"openTrails":0,"groomedTrails":0,"totalLifts":0,"openLifts":0},"activities":{},"currentConditions":{"base":{"location":"Base","name":"Base","updated":null,"temperature_f":24,"temperature_c":null,"wind_direction":null,"wind_speed_mph":null,"wind_gusts_mph":null,"skies":null,"conditions":null},"midMountain":{"location":"Mid Mountain","name":"Mid Mountain","updated":null,"temperature_f":20,"temperature_c":null,"wind_direction":null,"wind_speed_mph":1,"wind_gusts_mph":null,"skies":null,"conditions":null},"summit":{"location":"Summit","name":"Summit","updated":null,"temperature_f":14,"temperature_c":null,"wind_direction":null,"wind_speed_mph":15,"wind_gusts_mph":null,"skies":null,"conditions":null},"lastUpdated":null},"forecast":null,"provider":"ikon","apiProvider":"zaneray"}

Come log some vertical mileage because while the weekend is just around the corner, a mellow vibe pervades the scene. Just hop out of that bed and you'll see exactly what I mean. Broken cloud cover fills the valley alongside mild temperatures and gentle winds. Outside of the slight possibility of a passing snow shower, you can expect more of the same through the day. High temperatures will climb into the low 20s outside Corbet's Cabin and to near the freezing mark in the Village. A soft western breeze will join in the show, blowing no more than 10 mph. Ditch out early on the stationary corporate treadmill and enjoy a wild life that's moving rapidly downhill. -Lege","operatingStatus":{"totalLifts":13,"openLifts":0,"expectedOpenLifts":0},"snowfall":{"overnight_inches":0,"overnight_cm":0,"24hour_inches":0,"24hour_cm":0,"48hour_inches":2,"48hour_cm":5,"7day_inches":4,"7day_cm":10,"season_total_inches":219,"season_total_cm":556},"baseDepth":{"inches":49,"cm":124,"range_inches":null,"range_cm":null},"terrain":{"totalTrails":0,"openTrails":0,"groomedTrails":0,"totalLifts":0,"openLifts":0},"activities":{},"currentConditions":{"base":{"location":"Base","name":"Base","updated":null,"temperature_f":32,"temperature_c":null,"wind_direction":null,"wind_speed_mph":null,"wind_gusts_mph":null,"skies":null,"conditions":null},"midMountain":{"location":"Mid Mountain","name":"Mid Mountain","updated":null,"temperature_f":27,"temperature_c":null,"wind_direction":null,"wind_speed_mph":3,"wind_gusts_mph":null,"skies":null,"conditions":null},"summit":{"location":"Summit","name":"Summit","updated":null,"temperature_f":18,"temperature_c":null,"wind_direction":null,"wind_speed_mph":16,"wind_gusts_mph":null,"skies":null,"conditions":null},"lastUpdated":null},"forecast":null,"provider":"ikon","apiProvider":"zaneray"}
