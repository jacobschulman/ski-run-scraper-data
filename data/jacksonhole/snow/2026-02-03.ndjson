Today will feel quite similar to yesterday with skies partially obstructed as high cirrus clouds push across the area. Temps will continue to sit above average with a high of 34 at the base and 32 up high. Gusty northwest winds could hit 35 mph during the morning hours, but are expected to mellow out later in this afternoon. We might not have the pow, but the terrain remains exceptional and our groomers are the envy of the Rockies.

Warm temperatures will rise into the mid- to upper 20s at the summit and the upper 30s in Teton Village.
