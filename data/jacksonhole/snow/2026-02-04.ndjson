Tuesday is dawning with Rendezvous' upper slopes partially enshrouded in flurry-producing cloud cover, giving the mountain an alluring air of mysterium. Hop onto the tram and let your mind unwind in a moment of transitory delirium. The trippy cloud vapors and fast-passing showers will dissipate as the day rolls on, leaving mostly sunny skies for the afternoon. Warm temperatures will rise into the mid- to upper 20s at the summit and the upper 30s in Teton Village. Moderate northwest winds will keep those highs feeling a bit cooler as they blow between 5 and 25 mph. Don't feel bad if you succumb to dopamine's temptation. Just focus on the building buzz of sheer big-mountain elation. -Lege","operatingStatus":{"totalLifts":13,"openLifts":0,"expectedOpenLifts":0},"snowfall":{"overnight_inches":0,"overnight_cm":0,"24hour_inches":0,"24hour_cm":0,"48hour_inches":0,"48hour_cm":0,"7day_inches":3,"7day_cm":8,"season_total_inches":220,"season_total_cm":559},"baseDepth":{"inches":47,"cm":119,"range_inches":null,"range_cm":null},"terrain":{"totalTrails":0,"openTrails":0,"groomedTrails":0,"totalLifts":0,"openLifts":0},"activities":{},"currentConditions":{"base":{"location":"Base","name":"Base","updated":null,"temperature_f":23,"temperature_c":null,"wind_direction":null,"wind_speed_mph":null,"wind_gusts_mph":null,"skies":null,"conditions":null},"midMountain":{"location":"Mid Mountain","name":"Mid Mountain","updated":null,"temperature_f":25,"temperature_c":null,"wind_direction":null,"wind_speed_mph":4,"wind_gusts_mph":null,"skies":null,"conditions":null},"summit":{"location":"Summit","name":"Summit","updated":null,"temperature_f":23,"temperature_c":null,"wind_direction":null,"wind_speed_mph":17,"wind_gusts_mph":null,"skies":null,"conditions":null},"lastUpdated":null},"forecast":null,"provider":"ikon","apiProvider":"zaneray"}

The fat old sun is on the rise, and it's time for you to come play. Because a bluebird blast of vitamin D is a surefire way to skyrocket you over any hump day. A few high clouds here and there may drop a diffused shadow or two, but be prepared to strip a layer, as warm temperatures will zoar to around 30 outside Corbet's Cabin while Teton Village toys with the 40-degree mark. A gentle northwest breeze will only be able to cool things off a tiny bit, as it wafts through at no more than 10 mph.
