  "conditions": "6 AM—Good morning, Jackson Hole. Head for the Village, all you alpine adventurers, because Friday is dawning with the promise of boundless skies and spring-like temperatures. Following a brief inversion this morning, the highs will soar into the upper 30s on the deck of Corbet's Cabin and the mid-40s in the valley. A subtle touch from a south-southwest breeze will finish the scene as it blows between zilch and 10 mph. Often seductive and sometimes sedating, a little ski in the sunshine is always the right thing. So, don't even question it. It's not worth debating. Blow off work because a better time is waiting. -Lege",
