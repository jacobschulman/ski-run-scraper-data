  "conditions": "6 AM—Time to get up, Jackson Hole. Sure, it's Saturday, and you could easily take it chill and mild. But why not tap into your inner child by letting all your fall-line fantasies run totally wild? Morning clouds with the slim potential for a passing snow shower will add an air of mystery unseen as of late on the slopes of Teton Village before quickly giving way to beams of afternoon sunshine. High temperatures will tickle the freezing point at the summit and rise to the low 40s down in the Village. Light to moderate winds will shift out of the west as they blow in the 5-20 mph neighborhood. Now, I'm not going to pretend that every slope you descend will lead to a place where your ego can transcend. But as it's often been said, the fool who persists in his folly gets wise in the end. -Lege",
