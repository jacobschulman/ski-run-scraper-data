Moderate winds will be trending out of the WSW at 12-20 MPH with afternoon gusts reaching 30 MPH. The ski conditions will start off firm and fast in the morning and will soften up by early afternoon as warming temperatures reach the low 30's at the top of the Tram, while Teton Village hits the mid-40's by closing bell. Whether you are looking to put some stripes on your favorite run through the woods or out for a Sunday cruise, Rendezvous Mountain will pack a little something in for everyone today. Keep those ski boots dancing as the storm approaches. Stay safe out there! -MB  ","operatingStatus":{"totalLifts":13,"openLifts":13,"expectedOpenLifts":13},"snowfall":{"overnight_inches":0,"overnight_cm":0,"24hour_inches":0,"24hour_cm":0,"48hour_inches":0,"48hour_cm":0,"7day_inches":0,"7day_cm":0,"season_total_inches":220,"season_total_cm":559},"baseDepth":{"inches":46,"cm":117,"range_inches":null,"range_cm":null},"terrain":{"totalTrails":0,"openTrails":0,"groomedTrails":0,"totalLifts":0,"openLifts":0},"activities":{},"currentConditions":{"base":{"location":"Base","name":"Base","updated":null,"temperature_f":39,"temperature_c":null,"wind_direction":null,"wind_speed_mph":null,"wind_gusts_mph":null,"skies":null,"conditions":null},"midMountain":{"location":"Mid Mountain","name":"Mid Mountain","updated":null,"temperature_f":34,"temperature_c":null,"wind_direction":null,"wind_speed_mph":5,"wind_gusts_mph":null,"skies":null,"conditions":null},"summit":{"location":"Summit","name":"Summit","updated":null,"temperature_f":25,"temperature_c":null,"wind_direction":null,"wind_speed_mph":23,"wind_gusts_mph":null,"skies":null,"conditions":null},"lastUpdated":null},"forecast":null,"provider":"ikon","apiProvider":"zaneray"}
