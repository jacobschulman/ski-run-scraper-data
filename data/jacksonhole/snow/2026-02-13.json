It's Friday the 13th, but instead of slasher movie chills, we're conjuring up a fun-filled day of big-mountain thrills as the Rendezvous Royalty throw down for the claim of Corbet's Couloir supremacy. The weather will be sweet for both shredding and spectating, so head on out and do a little bit of both. Partly cloudy skies will conspire with highs near 20 at the summit and in the upper 30s down in Teton Village to create a wide variety of snow types for you to explore. Gentle winds will guide you on your way as they breeze between zip and 15 mph. At the end of the day, whether it's your first experience on skis or you wore them in the womb, don't forget: we're all really kings and queens when we test the limits of our personal extremes. -Lege",
