  "conditions": "6AM - Abraham Lincoln once said: \"Give me 6 hours to ski and I'll spend the first 4 hours sharpening my edges!\" We're not sure this is great advice, but we sleep easy knowing Honest Abe loved to shred as much as we do. Happy Presidents' Day everyone - we're looking at another relatively dry and mild day before the next storm system moves into the area. That storm is pushing winds ahead of it - ridgetop gusts are expected to top out at 40mph today. The base area will be balmy with an anticipated high of 43 degrees while summit temps should hover in the mid-20s. That next system moves in tonight, bringing with it a good chance of moderate snow and more seasonable temperatures. Happy Holidays everyone! - Orion",
