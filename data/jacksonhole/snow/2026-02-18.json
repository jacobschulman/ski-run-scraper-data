  "conditions": "6 AM—Greetings, Jackson Hole. Don't succumb to a midweek slumber; come witness the white renovation that Rendezvous Mountain is under. 6\" of high-grade pow landed in the upper elevations overnight, and periods of heavy snow are likely through the morning hours. Strong southwest winds may affect some lift operations today, but they will also help etch-a-sketch any pesky imperfections away as they crank between 15 and 40 mph. By the afternoon we'll see partly sunny skies, setting up a colorful sunset scenario to conclude your perfect pow day. Temperatures will be fairly steady, with the summit hovering in the upper teens to 20 degrees and Teton Village sitting in the low 30s. Who cares if logic makes it feel like a flaky superstition? Forget your inhibitions, follow that intuition, and let the experience be your only mission. -Lege",
