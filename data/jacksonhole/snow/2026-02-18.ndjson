But that's just the beginning; because periods of powfall will continue to pile until the day is over. The cold-smoking clouds you kick up will be swirling high, blown by light to moderate southwest winds in the 5 to 20 mph range. High temperatures begin a slight cooling trend today, with the summit stalling out in the teens and Teton Village right around the freezing mark. Entertain every crazy thought that may invade and embark on a frosty mountain escapade. Just beware, you could lose your mind. Because deep in the whiteroom it's nearly impossible to find. -Lege","operatingStatus":{"totalLifts":13,"openLifts":13,"expectedOpenLifts":13},"snowfall":{"overnight_inches":5,"overnight_cm":13,"24hour_inches":9,"24hour_cm":23,"48hour_inches":15,"48hour_cm":38,"7day_inches":30,"7day_cm":76,"season_total_inches":255,"season_total_cm":648},"baseDepth":{"inches":59,"cm":150,"range_inches":null,"range_cm":null},"terrain":{"totalTrails":0,"openTrails":0,"groomedTrails":0,"totalLifts":0,"openLifts":0},"activities":{},"currentConditions":{"base":{"location":"Base","name":"Base","updated":null,"temperature_f":31,"temperature_c":null,"wind_direction":null,"wind_speed_mph":null,"wind_gusts_mph":null,"skies":null,"conditions":null},"midMountain":{"location":"Mid Mountain","name":"Mid Mountain","updated":null,"temperature_f":21,"temperature_c":null,"wind_direction":null,"wind_speed_mph":4,"wind_gusts_mph":null,"skies":null,"conditions":null},"summit":{"location":"Summit","name":"Summit","updated":null,"temperature_f":11,"temperature_c":null,"wind_direction":null,"wind_speed_mph":25,"wind_gusts_mph":null,"skies":null,"conditions":null},"lastUpdated":null},"forecast":null,"provider":"ikon","apiProvider":"zaneray"}
