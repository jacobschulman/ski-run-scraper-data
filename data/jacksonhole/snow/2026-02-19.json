  "conditions": "6 AM—Wake up and walk into a world of white where all your trivial midweek cares fade far out of sight. 9 inches of fresh fell on Rendezvous Mountain over the past 24 hours, with more than half landing post-lift closure. But that's just the beginning; because periods of powfall will continue to pile until the day is over. The cold-smoking clouds you kick up will be swirling high, blown by light to moderate southwest winds in the 5 to 20 mph range. High temperatures begin a slight cooling trend today, with the summit stalling out in the teens and Teton Village right around the freezing mark. Entertain every crazy thought that may invade and embark on a frosty mountain escapade. Just beware, you could lose your mind. Because deep in the whiteroom it's nearly impossible to find. -Lege",
