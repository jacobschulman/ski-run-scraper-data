Pop outta that bed and come enjoy the lingering effects of yesterday's fantastic storm. 6\" fell on Rendezvous Mountain over the past 24 hours, with 1 of those settling after the lifts closed. Scattershot snow showers will continue to put the finishing touches on the storm total through the morning hours before giving way to some infiltrating sunbeams this afternoon. You might want to stop in to Corbet's Cabin for a warm waffle, because powder-preserving temperatures are going to top out in the single digits at the summit and in the low 20s down in Teton Village. Light to moderate west-southwest winds will keep your vapor trails swirling as they clock in between 5 and 25 mph. Don't feel like your exuberance is something to conceal when so many snowy treasures abound. The elevated euphoria is real, so give a shout and let the universe know every time another one is found. -Lege","operatingStatus":{"totalLifts":13,"openLifts":13,"expectedOpenLifts":13},"snowfall":{"overnight_inches":1,"overnight_cm":3,"24hour_inches":6,"24hour_cm":15,"48hour_inches":15,"48hour_cm":38,"7day_inches":22,"7day_cm":56,"season_total_inches":262,"season_total_cm":665},"baseDepth":{"inches":63,"cm":160,"range_inches":null,"range_cm":null},"terrain":{"totalTrails":0,"openTrails":0,"groomedTrails":0,"totalLifts":0,"openLifts":0},"activities":{},"currentConditions":{"base":{"location":"Base","name":"Base","updated":null,"temperature_f":22,"temperature_c":null,"wind_direction":null,"wind_speed_mph":null,"wind_gusts_mph":null,"skies":null,"conditions":null},"midMountain":{"location":"Mid Mountain","name":"Mid Mountain","updated":null,"temperature_f":11,"temperature_c":null,"wind_direction":null,"wind_speed_mph":5,"wind_gusts_mph":null,"skies":null,"conditions":null},"summit":{"location":"Summit","name":"Summit","updated":null,"temperature_f":2,"temperature_c":null,"wind_direction":null,"wind_speed_mph":8,"wind_gusts_mph":null,"skies":null,"conditions":null},"lastUpdated":null},"forecast":null,"provider":"ikon","apiProvider":"zaneray"}
