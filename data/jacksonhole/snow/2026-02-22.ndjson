I suggest you don't sleep in on what could be a sneaky little Saturday morning, thanks to a two-inch overnight adorning. Early clouds and stray snow showers will fade away, leaving partly cloudy conditions for the afternoon. Warmer, but still cool, high temperatures will just reach the double digits outside Corbet's Cabin and right around the 30-degree mark in the Village. West winds in the 5-20 mph range will keep the photons refracting from the vapor clouds lingering in your wake. Come out and let your common consciousness undergo a crystal alteration. But beware, a subtle insanity comes in the aftermath of this mystical revelation. -Lege","operatingStatus":{"totalLifts":13,"openLifts":0,"expectedOpenLifts":0},"snowfall":{"overnight_inches":0,"overnight_cm":0,"24hour_inches":0,"24hour_cm":0,"48hour_inches":2,"48hour_cm":5,"7day_inches":26,"7day_cm":66,"season_total_inches":268,"season_total_cm":681},"baseDepth":{"inches":61,"cm":155,"range_inches":null,"range_cm":null},"terrain":{"totalTrails":0,"openTrails":0,"groomedTrails":0,"totalLifts":0,"openLifts":0},"activities":{},"currentConditions":{"base":{"location":"Base","name":"Base","updated":null,"temperature_f":13,"temperature_c":null,"wind_direction":null,"wind_speed_mph":null,"wind_gusts_mph":null,"skies":null,"conditions":null},"midMountain":{"location":"Mid Mountain","name":"Mid Mountain","updated":null,"temperature_f":20,"temperature_c":null,"wind_direction":null,"wind_speed_mph":6,"wind_gusts_mph":null,"skies":null,"conditions":null},"summit":{"location":"Summit","name":"Summit","updated":null,"temperature_f":15,"temperature_c":null,"wind_direction":null,"wind_speed_mph":24,"wind_gusts_mph":null,"skies":null,"conditions":null},"lastUpdated":null},"forecast":null,"provider":"ikon","apiProvider":"zaneray"}
