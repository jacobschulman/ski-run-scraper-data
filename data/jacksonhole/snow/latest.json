Early morning sunshine will yield to encroaching cloud cover before midday, so come quick and you may catch a couple rays. But, even if you miss 'em, stick around. Because before too long, some cool frosty flakes should be coming down. High temperatures will top out near 20 at the summit and in the upper 20s down in the Village. Winds should remain on the light side, breezing out of the west in the 5-15 mph range. Head for the slopes without fear or hesitation. Because the time has come to get a little zesty with the forces of gravitation, as a sacrificial offering to the atmosphere for an extra hefty powder application. - Lege",
